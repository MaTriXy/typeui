# typeui.sh User Guide

This guide is for end users who run the `typeui.sh` CLI in a project to generate and maintain design-system skill files.

## What typeui.sh does

`typeui.sh` asks you a series of interactive questions about your design system, then generates `SKILL.md` files for coding agents.

- Universal target is always generated: `.agents/skills/design-system/SKILL.md`
- You can optionally generate additional agent-specific files during the provider selection step.

## Before you start

- Node.js 18+ recommended
- A valid license key from your Polar purchase (required for `pull` and `list`; not required for `generate` or `update`)

## Install and run

Use the published CLI (recommended for end users):

```bash
npx typeui.sh --help
```

Or if the package is already installed globally:

```bash
typeui.sh --help
```

## License key activation for registry commands (Polar purchase)

### 1) Get your license key

After purchase, Polar provides your license key. Copy it exactly.

### 2) Verify against the default endpoint

`typeui.sh` verifies your key directly with:

- `https://typeui.sh/api/license/verify`

### 3) Activate in CLI (for `pull` and `list`)

Run:

```bash
npx typeui.sh verify
```

You will be prompted for:

- `License key:` (hidden input)

If valid, the CLI caches your license locally in:

- `~/.typeui-sh/license.json`

Useful license commands:

- `npx typeui.sh license` - show cached license status
- `npx typeui.sh clear-cache` - clear local cache and force re-verification

## Generate design-system skills (free)

Run:

```bash
npx typeui.sh generate
```

### Provider selection behavior

At the start of the flow:

- `.agents/skills` is included automatically
- A short list is shown so you know which agents are covered by the universal target
- You can select additional optional provider targets

### Design-system interview flow

You will be prompted for:

1. Product basics
   - Product name
   - Brand summary
2. Visual style directions
   - Multi-select preset list (+ optional custom values)
3. Typography
   - Typography scale strategy (exactly one selected)
   - Primary UI font family (Google Fonts, choose one)
   - Display/heading font family (Google Fonts, choose one)
   - Monospace font family (Google Fonts, choose one)
   - Core font weights (checkbox list, all selected by default)
4. Color palette
   - Palette guidance presets (+ optional custom values)
   - Token values for primary, secondary, success, warning, danger, surface, text
5. Spacing
   - Spacing scale guidance (exactly one selected)
6. Component families
   - Multi-select list (+ optional custom values)
7. Accessibility requirements
   - Multi-select list (+ optional custom values)
8. Writing tone
   - Multi-select list (+ optional custom values)
9. Rules
   - Design DO rules (multi-select + optional custom)
   - Design DON'T rules (multi-select + optional custom)

## Update existing skill files

If files already exist, you can update selected design-system fields (free):

```bash
npx typeui.sh update
```

The CLI will:

- Read existing managed content
- Ask which fields to update
- Rewrite only the managed block in each `SKILL.md`

## Pull a published registry skill

Use this when you already know the published skill slug and want to fetch the authored markdown directly:

```bash
npx typeui.sh pull paper
```

Behavior:

- The CLI asks for provider targets the same way as `generate/update` (unless `--providers` is passed).
- Universal target is always included.
- This command requires an activated license.
- The CLI uses the cached license key if present; otherwise it prompts for one and verifies it.
- The CLI sends `POST /api/registry/pull/:slug` with `{ "licenseKey": "..." }`.
- On success, the pulled markdown is written to selected provider `SKILL.md` paths.

You can combine `pull` with `--providers` and `--dry-run`:

```bash
npx typeui.sh pull paper --providers cursor,codex
npx typeui.sh pull paper --dry-run
```

## List available registry specs

Use this to choose one available design-system spec for your current license, then pull it immediately:

```bash
npx typeui.sh list
```

Behavior:

- This command requires an activated license.
- The CLI uses your cached license key when available; otherwise it prompts and verifies.
- The CLI sends `POST /api/registry/specs` with `{ "licenseKey": "..." }`.
- On success, it shows a checkbox selection where exactly one spec can be selected.
- After you confirm the selection, the CLI automatically runs pull for that slug.

You can pass pull options through list:

```bash
npx typeui.sh list --providers cursor,codex
npx typeui.sh list --dry-run
```

## Preview changes without writing files

Use `--dry-run` with generate, update, or pull:

```bash
npx typeui.sh generate --dry-run
npx typeui.sh update --dry-run
npx typeui.sh pull paper --dry-run
```

## Select providers from CLI options

You can bypass interactive provider selection:

```bash
npx typeui.sh generate --providers cursor,claude-code,mistral-vibe
```

Notes:

- Provider keys are comma-separated.
- Universal target (`.agents/skills`) is still included automatically.

## Where files are written

Every generated target writes:

- `.../skills/design-system/SKILL.md`

Examples:

- `.agents/skills/design-system/SKILL.md` (always)
- `.cursor/skills/design-system/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/design-system/SKILL.md`
- `.codex/skills/design-system/SKILL.md`
- `.opencode/skills/design-system/SKILL.md`

## Troubleshooting

- **"License verification failed"**
  - Check your key.
  - Confirm you can reach `https://typeui.sh/api/license/verify`.
- **"No cached license"**
  - Run `npx typeui.sh verify`.
- **"No existing managed design system found" on update**
  - Run `npx typeui.sh generate` first.
- **Wrong files generated**
  - Re-run with `--dry-run` to verify target paths before writing.
- **"Registry pull failed: license_invalid"**
  - Re-check your license key and ensure it is active.
- **"Registry pull failed: not_found"**
  - Verify the slug exists and has published markdown.
- **"Registry specs failed: license_invalid"**
  - Re-check your license key and ensure it is active.
